(ulimit -v 6500; ./cub3D maps/map1.cub)


- players spawn position and view


- .cub file accepted (so it is a hidden file). Check that the len is atleast 5.
- Map content can not be separated by newlines, but in ur case it's possible
- Textures checked only for first two letters (should check the whole token) example: EAA - is valid, should be not. Also you arg like '      EA       ./path' should be valid
