#FOR PRINTING THE FILTERED TEST RESULT ACCORDING TO TEST PART (STD_OUT,ERR,ETC)#
#
# This is a script to be used alongside the minishell tester of zstenger93.
# (https://github.com/zstenger93/42_minishell_tester).
# git clone https://github.com/zstenger93/42_minishell_tester.git
#
# 1. Copy zstenger's minishell tester in the root of your minishell folder.
# (Follow his instructions; you have to give execution permission to his tester)
# 2. Put this script in the root of your minishell folder.
# 3. Give it execution permission (chmod +x print_filtered_result.sh).
# 4. Inside this script look for
# "/nfs/homes/marondon/42_minishell_tester" and change
# marondon with your username. (the script needs the full path to
# 42_minishell_tester/tester.sh)
# 5. Execute it (./print_filtered_result.sh) and it'll automatically run
# zstenger's minishell tester.
#
# It ask for:
# The test mode to use (m, vm, d, ne, b, etc) (read zstenger93 tester usage).
# The failed "test part" to print (e.g: STD_OUT, STD_ERR, etc)
# Then it runs the whole test, and only prints the fails on the selected parts;
# but WITHOUT including the testfile contents.
# So you'll only see in what you fail, but not the commands that were used
# to test your minishell.
